The Team plan is a paid plan for our Claude chat experience built for ambitious teams. It is currently available in certain [supported locations](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/8461763-where-can-i-access-claude). 
## What’s included in the Team plan?
Users with standard seats on the Team plan can access the following:
  * **Increased usage:** More usage per user than the Pro plan, so every team member can get what they need from Claude.
  * **Option to purchase extra usage:** Prepay for extra usage, allowing team members to continue working after reaching limits.
    * Read more here: [Extra Usage for Claude for Work (Team and Enterprise) Plans](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12005970-extra-usage-for-claude-for-work-team-and-enterprise-plans).

  * **Advanced identity and access management:**
    * **Single-Sign-On (SSO) and Domain Capture:** Enhance authentication security and user experience.
    * **Just-in-Time Provisioning (JIT):** Streamline user authentication and manage access across your organization.
    * **Role-based permissioning:** Customize access levels and control user privileges across your organization.
  * **Spend controls:** Set spending caps at organization and individual user levels.
  * **​​Enterprise search capabilities:** Dedicated search project for unified knowledge access
    * Pre-configured with optimized search instructions
    * Automatic provisioning for all organization members
    * Search across Slack, Microsoft 365, and custom connectors

  * **Everything in Pro, including:**
    * Access to all available models within the Claude 3 and 4 model families.
    * Access to projects, knowledge bases, and collaboration features.
    * 200k context window. Room to process long documents, discuss complex topics, and maintain multi-step conversations.
    * Priority access during high-traffic periods, early access to new features, more usage, and more.


## Premium seats for Team plans
In addition to all features of standard seats listed above, premium seats include:
  * **Access to Claude Code:** Delegate coding tasks from concept to completion directly from your terminal.
  * **More usage**


Organizations can mix and match seat types, assigning premium seats to power users who need more usage or Claude Code access while keeping other team members on standard seats.
Refer to this article for more information about premium seats: [How to purchase and manage premium seats](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12004354-how-to-purchase-and-manage-premium-seats).
