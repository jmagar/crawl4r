"Claude Sonnet 4.5's edit capabilities are exceptional — we went from 9% error rate on Sonnet 4 to 0% on our internal code editing benchmark. Higher tool success at lower cost is a major leap for agentic coding. Claude Sonnet 4.5 balances creativity and control perfectly, thoroughly completing tasks without over-engineering."
