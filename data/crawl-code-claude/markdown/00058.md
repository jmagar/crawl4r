Configuration
# Optimize your terminal setup
Copy page
Claude Code works best when your terminal is properly configured. Follow these guidelines to optimize your experience.

### Themes and appearance
Claude cannot control the theme of your terminal. That’s handled by your terminal application. You can match Claude Code’s theme to your terminal any time via the `/config` command. For additional customization of the Claude Code interface itself, you can configure a [custom status line](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline) to display contextual information like the current model, working directory, or git branch at the bottom of your terminal.
### Line breaks
You have several options for entering line breaks into Claude Code:
  * **Quick escape** : Type `\` followed by Enter to create a newline
  * **Shift+Enter** : Works out of the box in iTerm2, WezTerm, Ghostty, and Kitty
  * **Keyboard shortcut** : Set up a keybinding to insert a newline in other terminals

**Set up Shift+Enter for other terminals** Run `/terminal-setup` within Claude Code to automatically configure Shift+Enter for VS Code, Alacritty, Zed, and Warp.
The `/terminal-setup` command is only visible in terminals that require manual configuration. If you’re using iTerm2, WezTerm, Ghostty, or Kitty, you won’t see this command because Shift+Enter already works natively.
**Set up Option+Enter (VS Code, iTerm2 or macOS Terminal.app)** **For Mac Terminal.app:**
  1. Open Settings → Profiles → Keyboard
  2. Check “Use Option as Meta Key”

**For iTerm2 and VS Code terminal:**
  1. Open Settings → Profiles → Keys
  2. Under General, set Left/Right Option key to “Esc+“


### Notification setup
Never miss when Claude completes a task with proper notification configuration:
#### iTerm 2 system notifications
For iTerm 2 alerts when tasks complete:
  1. Open iTerm 2 Preferences
  2. Navigate to Profiles → Terminal
  3. Enable “Silence bell” and Filter Alerts → “Send escape sequence-generated alerts”
  4. Set your preferred notification delay

Note that these notifications are specific to iTerm 2 and not available in the default macOS Terminal.
#### Custom notification hooks
For advanced notification handling, you can create [notification hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#notification) to run your own logic.
### Handling large inputs
When working with extensive code or long instructions:
  * **Avoid direct pasting** : Claude Code may struggle with very long pasted content
  * **Use file-based workflows** : Write content to a file and ask Claude to read it
  * **Be aware of VS Code limitations** : The VS Code terminal is particularly prone to truncating long pastes


### Vim Mode
Claude Code supports a subset of Vim keybindings that can be enabled with `/vim` or configured via `/config`. The supported subset includes:
  * Mode switching: `Esc` (to NORMAL), `i`/`I`, `a`/`A`, `o`/`O` (to INSERT)
  * Navigation: `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`, `w`/`e`/`b`, `0`/`$`/`^`, `gg`/`G`, `f`/`F`/`t`/`T` with `;`/`,` repeat
  * Editing: `x`, `dw`/`de`/`db`/`dd`/`D`, `cw`/`ce`/`cb`/`cc`/`C`, `.` (repeat)
  * Yank/paste: `yy`/`Y`, `yw`/`ye`/`yb`, `p`/`P`
  * Text objects: `iw`/`aw`, `iW`/`aW`, `i"`/`a"`, `i'`/`a'`, `i(`/`a(`, `i[`/`a[`, `i{`/`a{`
  * Indentation: `>>`/`<<`
  * Line operations: `J` (join lines)
