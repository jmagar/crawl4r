[IFS Nexus Black](https://www.ifs.com/nexus-black) builds AI-powered software for companies in manufacturing, field service, energy, aerospace, and defense—industries where keeping planes in the air, power grids running, and factory lines moving isn't negotiable.
Their flagship product, Resolve, is an AI assistant built on Claude that works alongside engineers on transmission poles, in engine rooms, and out in the field—spotting what humans might miss by analyzing equipment images, correlating sensor readings, and catching problems before they become failures.
With Claude, IFS Nexus Black:
  * Helps manufacturers move from reactive repairs to predictive maintenance—William Grant & Sons is set to save millions annually at one distillery site
  * Resolves faults in assets at a plant, site or in the field 25% faster with AI that works for engineers in the field


## The Challenge
Industrial companies need AI that works in their actual operating environments. Engineers can't type into a chatbot when they're wearing gloves. Offshore wind farms need systems that work without signal. Manufacturing plants require solutions that speak the language of their 40-year-old machinery.
In these environments, one mistake prolongs a power outage, shuts down a production line, or costs millions in wasted inventory. Results need to happen fast.
IFS Nexus Black brings together AI specialists and the industrial knowledge of IFS, a global software company with four decades of experience across manufacturing, energy, utilities, telecoms, construction and engineering, aerospace and defense. 
## Claude enables production-ready AI for critical industries
Claude's capabilities opened up approaches that weren't possible before. Resolve uses Claude's multimodal capabilities to analyze thousands of equipment images, correlate sensor readings, and connect patterns across visual inspections and operational data to catch problems before they become failures.
The Model Context Protocol (MCP), built and open-sourced by Anthropic, facilitates easier connections between systems—including legacy infrastructure that has traditionally been challenging to integrate. This enables Claude to bridge data silos that have long complicated industrial operations. And [Skills by Claude](https://www.claude.com/blog/skills) helps IFS manage the complex context that comes with decades of industrial data—ensuring engineers get relevant, accurate information without drowning in documentation. 
"We're working in environments where safety and compliance aren't optional," said Kriti Sharma, CEO of IFS Nexus Black. "If you don't build AI safety-first in our world, lives are put at risk."
Anthropic's commitment to safe and reliable AI aligns with the operational requirements of industries where system failures have severe consequences.
### Transforming a Scottish distillery's operations
William Grant & Sons—whose iconic distilleries produce Grant's whisky and Hendrick's gin—had just completed a major expansion at their facility on Scotland's west coast. They saw an opportunity to improve efficiency in their operations.
Fragmented data meant technicians had to react to problems instead of preventing them. 38% of repairs were reactive, leading to costly downtime. 
With Resolve, the distillery can now predict failures before they happen. The solution reads complex plant schematics like a trained engineer and connects to existing sensors to catch problems early. During repairs, it diagnoses faults in real time, thanks to Claude's multimodal capabilities combined with IFS's domain expertise.
"IFS Nexus Black understood our industry—they weren't trying to apply something generic," said Badri Narasimhan, Chief Technology & Business Growth Officer for William Grant & Sons. "It's been innovation that's practical, fast, and connected to results, not theory."
The distillery has slashed downtime and boosted output, and the team estimates that these changes will save them £8.4 million a year at this one site alone—once they are in business-as-usual mode. 
### Moving disaster relief beyond clipboards
The team used Anthropic's Agent SDK to develop agentic capabilities that can coordinate across multiple field service workflows, from initial diagnostics to parts ordering and final verification. And possible use cases extend from the factory floor to disaster recovery efforts.
Resolve is assessing when storms could intensify and identifying which areas face the highest risk of disruption. Utility technicians are then directed to the highest-priority sites, and teams across different utilities are coordinated for a faster response. On-site, Resolve acts as an extension of an engineer's expertise—advising on repairs based on image or video capture and automatically redirecting essential parts.
## The outcome
Resolve represents the first major product from IFS Nexus Black's work with Anthropic, but the applications will continue to extend beyond emergency response and manufacturing.
"Industries like these may not make headlines," said Kriti Sharma. "But there's a quiet transformation happening here—supporting the workers who keep the lights on, the shelves stocked, and the world turning."
"With Anthropic, the AI we build goes where it's needed most."
