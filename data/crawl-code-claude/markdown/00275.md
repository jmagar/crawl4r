The Enterprise plan is designed for organizations that require advanced capabilities, enhanced security, and scalable solutions to empower every employee with AI. This plan builds upon the features of [our Team plan](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9266767-what-is-the-team-plan), providing a robust set of tools and resources to meet the complex needs of your business.
## What’s included in the Enterprise plan?
The Enterprise plan supports deep, cross-functional workflows and includes everything in the Team plan in addition to the following features:
  * **Enterprise-grade security features** to ensure the safety and compliance of your organization's data including:
    * **Single-Sign-On (SSO) and Domain Capture:** Enhance authentication security and user experience.
    * **Just-in-Time Provisioning (JIT)** : Streamline user authentication and manage access across your organization.
    * **Role based permissioning:** Customize access levels and control user privileges across your organization.
    * **Audit Logs:** Capture key information about user actions, system events, and data access.
    * **System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)**
    * **Custom data retention controls**
    * **Compliance API:** Programmatically access Claude usage data including activity logs, chat histories, and file content, with filtering capabilities by user and time range.
  * **Enhanced context window** that enables users to upload hundreds of sales transcripts, dozens of 100+ page documents, and 100K lines of code.
    * When using Claude Sonnet 4.5, there is a 500k context window when chatting with Claude and a 1M context window for Claude Code.
