## Available models
For the `model` setting in Claude Code, you can configure either:
  * A **model alias**
  * A **model name**
    * Anthropic API: A full **[model name](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview#model-names)**
    * Bedrock: an inference profile ARN
    * Foundry: a deployment name
    * Vertex: a version name


### Model aliases
Model aliases provide a convenient way to select model settings without remembering exact version numbers:
Model alias | Behavior  
---|---  
**`default`**|  Recommended model setting, depending on your account type  
**`sonnet`**|  Uses the latest Sonnet model (currently Sonnet 4.5) for daily coding tasks  
**`opus`**|  Uses Opus model (currently Opus 4.5) for specialized complex reasoning tasks  
**`haiku`**|  Uses the fast and efficient Haiku model for simple tasks  
**`sonnet[1m]`**|  Uses Sonnet with a [1 million token context window](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) window for long sessions  
**`opusplan`**|  Special mode that uses `opus` during plan mode, then switches to `sonnet` for execution  
### Setting your model
You can configure your model in several ways, listed in order of priority:
  1. **During session** - Use `/model <alias|name>` to switch models mid-session
  2. **At startup** - Launch with `claude --model <alias|name>`
  3. **Environment variable** - Set `ANTHROPIC_MODEL=<alias|name>`
  4. **Settings** - Configure permanently in your settings file using the `model` field.

Example usage:
```
# Start with Opus
claude --model opus

# Switch to Sonnet during session
/model sonnet

```

Example settings file:
```
{
    "permissions": {
        ...
    },
    "model": "opus"
}

```

## Special model behavior
### `default` model setting
The behavior of `default` depends on your account type. For certain Max users, Claude Code will automatically fall back to Sonnet if you hit a usage threshold with Opus.
### `opusplan` model setting
The `opusplan` model alias provides an automated hybrid approach:
  * **In plan mode** - Uses `opus` for complex reasoning and architecture decisions
  * **In execution mode** - Automatically switches to `sonnet` for code generation and implementation

This gives you the best of both worlds: Opus’s superior reasoning for planning, and Sonnet’s efficiency for execution.
### Extended context with [1m]
For Console/API users, the `[1m]` suffix can be added to full model names to enable a [1 million token context window](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window).
```
# Example of using a full model name with the [1m] suffix
/model anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0[1m]

```

Note: Extended context models have [different pricing](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/pricing#long-context-pricing).
## Checking your current model
You can see which model you’re currently using in several ways:
  1. In [status line](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline) (if configured)
  2. In `/status`, which also displays your account information.


## Environment variables
You can use the following environment variables, which must be full **model names** (or equivalent for your API provider), to control the model names that the aliases map to.
Environment variable | Description  
---|---  
`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` | The model to use for `opus`, or for `opusplan` when Plan Mode is active.  
`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | The model to use for `sonnet`, or for `opusplan` when Plan Mode is not active.  
`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | The model to use for `haiku`, or [background functionality](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/costs#background-token-usage)  
`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` | The model to use for [subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)  
Note: `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` is deprecated in favor of `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`.
### Prompt caching configuration
Claude Code automatically uses [prompt caching](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) to optimize performance and reduce costs. You can disable prompt caching globally or for specific model tiers:
Environment variable | Description  
---|---  
`DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for all models (takes precedence over per-model settings)  
`DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_HAIKU` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Haiku models only  
`DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_SONNET` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Sonnet models only  
`DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_OPUS` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Opus models only  
These environment variables give you fine-grained control over prompt caching behavior. The global `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING` setting takes precedence over the model-specific settings, allowing you to quickly disable all caching when needed. The per-model settings are useful for selective control, such as when debugging specific models or working with cloud providers that may have different caching implementations.
