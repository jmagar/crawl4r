The bioRxiv connector gives Claude access to bioRxiv and medRxiv preprint servers, hosting research papers in biological and medical sciences posted before peer review. Search for preprints by topic, funder, or category. Track publication outcomes and analyze research trends across the life sciences.
You can use the bioRxiv connector to:
**Conduct a Literature Review:** "I'm researching CRISPR applications in cancer therapy. Find recent preprints on this topic."
**Track Publication Outcomes:** "Has the preprint DOI 10.1101/2023.05.15.540789 been published in a journal?"
**Analyze Funding Patterns:** "What COVID-19 research has the NIH funded? Show me preprints from 2020-2021."
**Explore Research Categories:** "What are the most active research categories on bioRxiv this month?"

  * Help me develop a unique voice for an audience
[](https://claude.com/connectors/biorxiv)
Hi Claude! Could you help me develop a unique voice for an audience? If you need more information from me, ask me 1-2 key questions right away. If you think I should upload any documents that would help you do a better job, let me know. You can use the tools you have access to— like Google Drive, web search, etc.—if they’ll help you better accomplish this task. Do not use analysis tool. Please keep your responses friendly, brief and conversational.   
  
Please execute the task as soon as you can—an artifact would be great if it makes sense. If using an artifact, consider what kind of artifact (interactive, visual, checklist, etc.) might be most helpful for this specific task. Thanks for your help!
