Ramp, a leading financial operations platform, has built a reputation for development velocity—shipping new features almost every other day that help companies control spend and automate manual work.
With Claude Code, Ramp is transforming their software development processes—enabling developers to build applications faster, collaborate more effectively, and deliver greater value to customers.
With Claude Code, Ramp achieved:
  * 1+ million lines of AI-suggested code implemented in just 30 days
  * 50% weekly active usage across engineering
  * Up to 80% reduction in incident investigation time with new internal tooling


## Engineering meets AI at Ramp
Ramp helps businesses save time and money through their advanced financial platform, offering spend management solutions that enable merchant-level restrictions, automated approval workflows, and streamlined expense processing. Known for their engineering-first approach, Ramp is now applying the same innovative mindset that drives their customer products to their internal development practices with Claude Code.
Austin Ray, Senior Software Engineer at Ramp said, "Technology has always been our competitive advantage at Ramp. We've built a culture that consistently seeks out and rapidly adopts the most advanced tools available. When we discovered Claude Code, our teams immediately recognized its potential and integrated it into our workflows, continuing the company’s tradition of embracing cutting-edge technology"
## Why Ramp embraced Claude Code
After evaluating multiple AI coding assistants, Ramp's engineering team found Claude Code offered unique capabilities that matched their development needs. What began as individual experimentation quickly evolved into a grassroots movement.
"Engineers would try it on their own and have such a transformative experience that they felt compelled to share with their colleagues. That initial experience created enthusiasm that spread further across our organization,” explained Ray.
The rapid spread is backed by compelling metrics: many engineers use Claude Code daily and nearly 50% use it weekly. This high retention rate shows engineers are increasingly adopting and benefiting from Claude Code. The team particularly values Claude Code’s effective tool integration and strong code suggestions, which set it apart from other AI models.
Ramp's relationship with Anthropic has further accelerated adoption. "Our partnership with the Anthropic team has been exceptional," explained Ray. "We have direct communication channels where our engineers can flag issues as they arise, and the response has consistently been swift and effective. This level of support has built tremendous trust in both Claude Code and our relationship with Anthropic, making it easier for us to confidently expand our use of the tool."
## A more productive and resilient engineering org
Here’s how Ramp engineers use Claude Code to move even faster:
  * **Test automation** : Ramp has developed extensions to Claude Code that streamline the development-test loop by connecting Claude Code to their testing frameworks through the flexible command-line interface. Since Claude Code can be invoked through the terminal and process standard input/output streams—similar to traditional developer tools—Ramp engineers can easily pipe inputs and outputs between it and their testing frameworks, creating custom abstractions that automate the repetitive cycle of writing code, creating tests, and fixing errors. Claude Code independently analyzes test failures, makes the necessary code adjustments, and reruns tests until everything passes—all through familiar interfaces that integrate smoothly with their existing development environment.
  * **Enhanced documentation** : Claude Code automatically generates comprehensive documentation across Ramp's codebase, improving the documentation process with consistent, contextual information useful for both current and future development.
  * **Parallel development workflows** : Developers run multiple Claude Code sessions simultaneously on the same codebase, each handling different tasks. This parallel processing eliminates wait time and significantly increases throughput.
  * **AI-powered incident response** : Ramp is building specialized tools for incident management by connecting Claude Code to their observability stack such as Datadog and Sentry. Claude Code integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to autonomously aggregate logs, error reports, and system metrics when incidents occur, giving engineers consolidated, relevant information quickly. Early observations suggest this integration could reduce initial incident triage time by up to 80% because on-call engineers can quickly understand complex system issues without manually piecing together data from multiple sources.
  * **Ticket-to-code automation** : Engineers connect project management systems directly to Claude Code, which pulls ticket context, understands requirements, and implements solutions without manual information transfers.


## Empowering AI experimentation across teams
While engineers at Ramp have integrated Claude Code deeply into their development practices—processing over one million lines of AI-suggested code monthly—teams across the organization are also adopting Claude Code for specialized workflows. "We're seeing usage across product, design, data teams, and definitely engineering," said Zack Field, Engineer at Ramp. "The data use cases are particularly interesting—allowing team members to interact with our Snowflake data warehouse using natural language instead of writing complex queries."
This natural language interface has empowered non-technical staff in sales, risk, accounting, finance, and recruiting to extract valuable insights directly from company data without requiring specialized coding knowledge.
## How AI fits into Ramp’s long-term view
Rather than just helping engineers work faster, Ramp is focused on optimizing their AI tools' effectiveness through organization-wide process changes. This approach creates a virtuous cycle where both engineers and AI systems improve together, generating compounding benefits over time.
Ramp is excited about what the future of building will hold, and how the software engineering landscape will evolve as AI capabilities continue to advance. Already, Claude Code Code helps engineers leverage their skills, enabling them to focus on work that matters: building and shipping products that save time and money. Ramp sees a future where engineers focus increasingly on high-level architecture, innovation, and customer-centric problem solving, while AI handles more implementation details. By pioneering these workflows today, Ramp is positioning themselves at the forefront of the AI-powered development revolution, creating new possibilities that benefit both their team and customers.
