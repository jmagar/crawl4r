FAQ
### How does Claude Code work with the Chrome extension?
Developers can use Claude Code to build and test directly in Chrome. This integration enables faster iteration on browser-based projects.
### How does Claude Desktop work with the Chrome extension? 
Desktop app users can start a task in [Claude Desktop](http://claude.com/download) and let it handle work in the browser without switching windows by enabling Claude in Chrome as a connector. 
### What browser activity is not recommended?
Avoid financial transactions, password management, or anything involving sensitive personal data. Start with trusted sites and familiar workflows where you're comfortable having Claude take actions. Never use it for high-stakes decisions without careful supervision. And, of course, make sure your use complies with our [acceptable use policy](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/12005017-using-agents-according-to-our-usage-policy). [Learn more.](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12902428-using-claude-for-chrome-safely)
### How do I control what Claude can access?
Pre-approve actions that Claude can take on websites before you start working. You can review Claude's approach upfront, then let it run. Claude will still ask before taking certain irreversible or potentially harmful actions, like making a purchase. For trusted workflows, you can choose to skip all permissions, but you should supervise Claude closely. While some safeguards exist for sensitive actions, malicious actors could still trick Claude into unintended actions. [Learn more.](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12902446-claude-for-chrome-permissions-guide)
### What are the security risks?
Browser AI faces unique security risks, like prompt injection attacks, where malicious actors might try to trick Claude into unintended actions, such as sharing your bank information or deleting important files. While we’ve implemented protections, they aren’t foolproof. Attack vectors are constantly evolving and Claude may hallucinate, leading to actions that you did not intend. We’ve shared our testing results, including possible attack scenarios, so you can make informed decisions, and strongly encourage you to [read about the risks](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12902428-using-claude-for-chrome-safely) before using this product.
