## Our commitment to responsible AI in education
At Anthropic, we believe AI has the power to fundamentally transform education for the better, but only if educators and universities lead the charge. We develop Claude with powerful safeguards to ensure it remains a beneficial tool for students, faculty, and administrators.
### Design for true learning
We build tools that foster critical thinking through guided exploration, prioritizing deep conceptual understanding over convenient shortcuts.
### Ensure equitable access
We partner with institutions to make AI-enhanced education accessible to all students, regardless of background.
### Protect privacy and ensure security
We only use data to train our generative models when given permission, and we maintain security standards that meet your compliance needs.
### Provide transparency
We share what Claude can (and can’t) do honestly, empowering you to make informed decisions about how AI fits into your educational environment.

## How Claude works for education
Built to strengthen thinking, not replace it. Claude helps students and faculty develop transferable skills through guided discovery and real-world application.
### A thinking partner—not answer machine
Claude’s learning mode represents our commitment to education's true purpose: developing capable, independent thinkers.
  * Guides discovery rather than answering directly 
  * Develops thinking through Socratic questioning 
  * Focuses on principles instead of solutions 
  * Provides templates for research, study guides, and more

> claude fix the authentication error in our login flow
I'll investigate the auth error. Let me look at the relevant files.
Examining auth-related files...
‍
* src/services/authService.js
* src/components/Login.jsx
* src/store/authSlice.js
‍
Running the login flow...
‍
Error detected: "401 Unauthorized: Token expired"
‍
Root cause:
* Token refresh mechanism not handling expired tokens correctly
* Refresh token missing from request header
* Improper error handling for 401 responses
‍
Updating authService.js with proper refresh logic...
Updating request interceptor for 401 handling...
Testing the fix...
‍
* Login successful ✓
* Token refresh working ✓
* Proper redirection on expired tokens ✓
‍
Authentication error fixed! The login flow now properly handles token expiration.
