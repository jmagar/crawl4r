"The quality and the detail of what's possible to achieve from a single API call from Claude models is quite mind blowing compared to other LLMs."

Growing from a bootstrapped startup into a web services platform serving more than 3.5 million users across 150+ countries, [Hostinger](https://hostinger.com) is on a mission to make the internet accessible to everyone. Their diverse customer base ranges from first-time bloggers to professional design firms, all drawn by Hostinger’s core pillars: reliable, high-performance web solutions, 24/7 user support, and exceptional affordability. Now the company has partnered with Anthropic to launch Hostinger Horizons, a website and app builder that transforms natural language prompts into fully functional online presences.
## The problem
Aspiring entrepreneurs and creators come to Hostinger looking to bring their brilliant ideas to online life. At least half of this customer base, though, consists of business owners and creators who are experts in their own fields but lack coding skills, design expertise, and/or technical knowledge. Many of these new users, unfortunately, were abandoning their projects out of frustration before they finished or launched their website or app.
"The steep learning curve of traditional web builders was frustrating for these less-technical users, and this technical friction was driving substantial early-stage user churn," said Dainius Kavoliunas, Head of Product for Hostinger Horizons. Simply making the existing platform easier to use wasn’t enough, though: these vanishing users were looking to describe their vision using natural language and have their site or app come to life instantly.  
  
The company needed an AI solution that could serve as a true creative partner, not just another user tool. This meant finding technology that could interpret natural language user prompts to generate complete, multifaceted online presences – including functional codebases, conversion-optimized layouts, professional copy, and SEO-ready structures – all from a single interaction. Finding a way to do this would not just dramatically improve retention among Hostinger’s existing customers, but also open up a whole new market of creative users intimidated by traditional web building platforms.
## With Claude, Hostinger:
  * Launched Hostinger Horizons, the first AI-powered coding tool with integrated e-commerce capabilities
  * Transformed web creation from a days-long technical challenge into a conversational process that takes just minutes
  * Enabled less-technical users to build custom applications and online stores through natural language prompts
  * Expanded their addressable market to include ambitious creators who previously couldn't navigate traditional website builders
  * Banished the steep learning curve, delivered immediate results, and shrank early-stage user churn 


## From concept to launch in a single conversation
The natural solution, the company decided, would be an AI-powered website and web app builder they dubbed Hostinger Horizons. The goal was allowing less-technical users like entrepreneurs and business owners to simply describe their functional idea – say, a fitness tracker, or a specialized tool for their business – and have the system create actual, functioning applications customized to their specific needs.
Claude powers the core of Horizons, interpreting user descriptions to generate websites (complete with codebase, layouts, professional copy, and SEO structure) from a single API call. "Quality-wise, versus other models, we were blown away by the detail and scope of what Claude makes possible from a single API call," Kavoliunas explained. The team found that Claude's ability to understand complex, multi-step instructions allowed them to deliver unprecedented results with near zero technical overhead for users.   
  
**The Horizons application architecture was not a whole new build, but a hybrid combination of Claude's code generation capabilities with Hostinger's existing infrastructure.** Kavoliunas, who led the Horizons project, said that the implementation proved remarkably straightforward. “Integrating Claude family models was a breeze," he said. "The API documentation made it simple, clear and fast to get started."
Claude handles prompt interpretation and code generation of ready-to-launch website components, while Hostinger's platform provides related services like hosting, domains, and professional email. Most critically, Claude integrated with their own internally-built e-commerce engine that handles backend functionality like inventory, order management, and secure payments – making Hostinger Horizons the first ever AI-powered coding tool with integrated online store functionality.
## The solution
Today, Hostinger Horizons delivers on what Kavoliunas calls their "no code, no wait" promise. Users begin by simply describing their idea in their own words. Within minutes, they receive a unique, fully functional website complete with professional copy, optimized layouts, and thoughtful design. They can iterate with the Horizons agent and, once satisfied, publish their new website with a single click. "Before, we offered tools that made a complex process easier.” Kavoliunas said. “Now, we offer a product that entirely removes complexity.”  
  
The impact has been transformative for Hostinger's customer base. One freelance graphic designer, previously frustrated by restrictive e-commerce platforms, used Horizons to describe their vision for _a clean, minimalist portfolio site with a shop section to sell art prints, with categories for different sizes and a checkout._ Within minutes, Claude helped Horizons generate a fully functional e-commerce site with product gallery, integrated payment gateway, and appealing design.
"This user was able to launch their business in a single afternoon, saving what would have been thousands of dollars and weeks of work with a traditional developer," Kavoliunas said. "With Claude, we can finally fulfill the ultimate promise of our mission: we can help someone launch an idea they've been sitting on with virtually zero friction."
Claude has also helped Hostinger’s bottom line. “Operationally, integrating Claude has significantly accelerated our feature development cycle for Horizons,” he continued. “Because the model is capable of understanding complex, multiple-steps instructions, we can prototype and deploy new application templates in response to user demand.” This is a major competitive advantage for Hostinger, he added.  

## Looking to the future
Hostinger views their partnership with Anthropic as central to their long-term mission of simplifying technology and empowering creators, and the launch of Hostinger Horizons is just the beginning. With each advancement in Claude's capabilities, the team explores opportunities for new features like Hostinger Reach, an AI marketing assistant that designs and writes polished, mobile-ready emails.  
  
But each new tool is simply part of the fundamental shift that’s already happened: the evolution from platform to partner. “We are no longer just a service provider,” Kavoliunas said. “Now we are an active AI-powered partner in the creation process, turning user vision into reality in minutes."
