# Clean up promotional emails
Claude in Chrome can scan your inbox, identify promotional and marketing emails, and flag them for your review. You decide what to delete in bulk rather than clicking through one by one.

## Describe the task
Promotional emails accumulate faster than you can unsubscribe. Claude in Chrome can scan through your inbox, identify marketing emails, newsletters, and automated notifications, then present them as a list for you to review before deleting in bulk.
Tell Claude what to look for and what to leave alone. It flags candidates for deletion and waits for your approval before taking action.
Find emails I likely don't need so I can review and bulk delete.
**Flag these:**
  * Promotional emails from retailers/brands
  * Newsletters I haven't opened in 3+ months
  * Automated notifications (delivered shipping updates, expired calendar reminders)
  * Marketing emails from SaaS products


**Don't flag:**
  * Emails from actual people (not automated)
  * Anything with attachments
  * Anything from [my company domain]


**Output:** Show me the list organized by sender so I can review before deleting.

### Unsubscribe from unwanted messages
For senders that keep filling your inbox, have Claude unsubscribe instead of just deleting.
For the retailers with more than 15 emails, go through and unsubscribe me instead of just deleting. I don't want to continue receiving these messages.

### Flag subscription emails you may have missed
While scanning emails, Claude can spot receipts and payment confirmations from services you might have forgotten about.
While you're in there, can you find any recurring payment emails? I want to see which subscriptions I'm paying for and see if there are some I forgot to cancel.

## Tricks, tips, and troubleshooting
### Permissions before taking actions
Before clicking "send," "publish," "post," "submit," or similar action buttons, Claude asks for approval. This includes sending emails, posting to social media, submitting forms, or messaging others on your behalf.
### Save and schedule tasks with shortcut
Once your cleanup prompt works well, click the shortcut button below the prompt to save it as a shortcut. Next time, just type "/" to view the command instead of rewriting the whole prompt. Alternatively, you can schedule the shortcut to run automatically.
### Claude keeps working in the background
Claude keeps scanning even when you switch to other tabs—as long as Chrome is open. Turn on notifications in extension settings to get alerted when Claude finishes or needs your approval. You'll see a desktop notification when the cleanup list is ready.
