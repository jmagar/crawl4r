[N26](https://n26.com/) is building the bank the world loves to use, serving diverse, digital-native customers across 24 European markets. As a fully licensed bank, N26 provides a 100% digital banking experience powered by advanced digital, data, and AI technologies.
With Claude, N26 has:
  * Automated up to 70% of tasks across targeted processes, with ongoing improvements
  * Deployed 15+ internal use cases within the first year, growing AI initiatives fivefold
  * Reduced manual processing by up to 50% across specific processes
  * Launched new implementations in as little as 1-2 weeks, from ideation to initial evaluation


## The problem
As N26 rapidly scaled its customer base across multiple European markets, the company faced a critical challenge: ensuring service quality could keep pace with growth. Many essential processes remained manual, document-heavy, and time-consuming. The rising volume of customer interactions created bottlenecks that directly affected both customer experience and internal efficiency. Teams spent more and more time on document classification, information extraction, translation, and drafting materials based on complex multilingual sources.
N26 needed to fundamentally re-engineer these workflows to maintain the high-quality, responsive service their digital-native customers expected while supporting continued business expansion.
## Claude enables responsible, intelligent automation of complex banking workflows
N26 selected Claude for its advanced reasoning and multimodal capabilities, which proved essential for handling the sophisticated decision-making required in financial processes. Claude's availability through AWS Bedrock in Europe provided the regulatory compliance, security, and scalability that N26 required as a fully licensed bank.
## N26 deploys Claude across customer service functions
Since beginning work with Claude in 2024, N26 has integrated the AI assistant into more than 15 internal applications, working toward their goal of 70% automation in targeted areas. The deployments span the full customer service lifecycle.
N26's customer-facing virtual assistant now provides instant support in five languages, operating around the clock. Behind the scenes, Claude analyzes thousands of daily conversations, summarizing interactions and identifying trends to help improve service quality.
For chargeback requests, Claude handles the entire process of translating documentation, analyzing claims, and recommending decisions on complex cases with multiple verification requirements. "Claude was able to identify some details that the human eye missed," said Carolina Tavares, Lead Product Manager at N26.
Claude also processes incoming physical claim letters, classifying documents and initiating appropriate actions within the relevant teams. In financial crime analysis, the AI assists analysts by synthesizing customer data, recommending actions, and auto-drafting investigation reports.
Tavares added: "Deployment was rapid." For some opportunities, the team went from initial implementation to testing after only 1-2 weeks – a pace enabled by Claude's performance and straightforward integration. 
## The outcome
One year after implementing Claude, N26 has successfully automated up to 70% of tasks across targeted processes, with ongoing improvements continuing to drive those numbers higher. The impact extends across multiple dimensions of the business.
Manual processing time and backlogs have decreased significantly, allowing teams to focus on higher-value work. Customers receive faster answers and quicker resolution on critical issues. The accuracy and traceability of decision-making has improved, meeting the high standards required in the highly regulated banking sector.
Looking ahead, N26 is focusing on three key areas. First, the company is scaling existing automations. Second, they're tackling more intricate customer interactions using advanced models and agentic capabilities to enhance customer journeys. Third, they're pursuing growth and engagement initiatives, including rapid onboarding of new products and features, along with personalized and contextual insights for customers.
The partnership with Anthropic continues to deepen. N26 plans to pioneer adoption of Anthropic's most advanced models and capabilities, including new Claude versions and the Agent SDK for addressing complex scenarios. The companies are partnering closely to exchange best practices on AI development, including multi-agent approaches and secure practices around Model Context Protocol (MCP) and agent-to-agent communication in highly regulated sectors. N26 is also integrating Claude Code to support their engineering teams and boost productivity.
