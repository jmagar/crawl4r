## Describe the task
Claude reads your Google Calendar, finds each meeting's attendees in Salesforce, and drafts activity logs. You provide notes on what was discussed and review everything before Claude creates the records.
This works for logging a single day or catching up on a backlog. Claude handles the cross-referencing and formatting; you add the context that makes the logs useful.
Log my calls from today in Salesforce.
**Steps:**
  1. Go to my Google Calendar and find today's external meetings (skip internal)
  2. For each meeting, look up the attendees in Salesforce
  3. Create an activity log for each call—I'll provide a quick summary of what was discussed
  4. Format each log with next steps included


**Do not submit.** Show me everything for review before saving to Salesforce.

## Give Claude context
Claude uses browser use to work across your calendar and CRM through your existing browser sessions. If you're logged into Google Calendar and Salesforce, Claude can read your meetings, look up contacts, and create activity records. No API configuration or IT tickets required.
## Required context
Log into Google Calendar and Salesforce in Chrome before starting. Claude navigates between them using your existing sessions.

**Needs Your Input**
**5. NewCo Discovery**

### Update opportunity stages
While logging activities, update the opportunity records based on what you learned.
For Acme Corp, move the opportunity to "Demo Scheduled" and update the close date to end of Q1. Add Competitor X to the competitors field.

### Catch up on the week
Process multiple days of calls at once before a pipeline review.
I've fallen behind on logging. Can you do this for all my external meetings from the past week? I'll review everything before our Monday pipeline meeting.

### Create missing contacts
Add new contacts when attendees don't exist in Salesforce yet. Claude can create them and link the activity in one step.
Go ahead and create a contact for Alex at NewCo. His title is Director of Partnerships—you can pull the rest from his email signature in the calendar invite. Then log the activity against that new record.

## Tricks, tips, and troubleshooting
### Drag Calendar and Salesforce into the same tab group
For cross-app workflows, drag both Google Calendar and Salesforce into Claude's tab group. You'll see a tab group highlighting the tabs Claude can access. Now Claude can read calendar attendees and look up Salesforce contacts simultaneously—no tab switching. Before visiting new sites, Claude asks for permission. You can grant site-level permissions for websites you trust, allowing Claude to work without repeated approvals on those specific domains.
### Permissions before taking actions
Before clicking "send," "publish," "post," "submit," or similar action buttons, Claude asks for approval. This includes sending emails, posting to social media, submitting forms, or messaging others on your behalf.
### Save your workflow as a shortcut
Once you have an activity log format that works, save the prompt as a shortcut by clicking on the shortcut icon below a successful prompt. You can also set a schedule for when you want the workflow to run next. Alternatively, manually trigger the workflow, by typing "/" and selecting the shortcut.
## Ready to try for yourself?
Claude in Chrome is available to all paid plan users. Install the extension, log into Google Calendar and Salesforce, and ask Claude to log today's calls. It works with your existing browser sessions—no integrations to configure.
