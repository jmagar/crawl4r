Triple Whale uses Claude to power AI agents that help brands of all sizes automate complex analyses and uncover valuable insights—revolutionizing how they manage customer acquisition, retention, and conversion strategies, and operations.
With Claude, Triple Whale’s agents:
  * Process up to 150,000 tokens of complex financial and marketing data
  * Plan and execute up to 1000 different analytical steps autonomously
  * Have helped early customers see increases in north star KPIs upwards of 50%, while reducing reporting time by over 70%


## Meeting the commerce analytics challenge
According to Triple Whale, brands struggle with fragmented data across multiple platforms, hindering a true understanding of their entire business, and ultimately, their ability to make confident decisions.
"Our founders faced these challenges running a brand firsthand, and, since our origin, believed AI would be the unlock to solving them," explains Anthony DelPizzo, Director of Product Marketing at Triple Whale.
They first built a consolidated data platform with proprietary pixel technology to capture comprehensive customer journey data, then optimized this architecture for AI applications. This foundation enabled them to develop MOI (Metrics, Optimization, and Intelligence) AI, which evolved into their current suite of Claude-powered agents.
## Why Triple Whale chose Claude for agent intelligence
After extensive testing, Triple Whale selected Claude 3.7 Sonnet as their default agent model due to its unique ability to maintain context and accuracy with large, complex numerical datasets.
"Our agent workflows require analyzing massive amounts of data—up to 150,000 tokens worth of dashboards and metrics," explains Maksim Gorev, AI Engineer at Triple Whale. "Most AI models lose context when processing large volumes of numerical data, but Claude consistently maintains accuracy and provides trustworthy insights. During our evaluations, Claude produced the most reliable results without distorting figures."
This accuracy is essential for Triple Whale's customers, who rely on these metrics for critical business decisions about marketing spend, inventory management, and growth strategies.
## How Claude powers intelligent agent workflows
Triple Whale has built a comprehensive AI agent system with Claude at its core, providing proactive, automated analysis to their customers:
  * **Agent Library** : Pre-built, customizable agents for acquisition, retention, website conversion, and business operations that brands can schedule to run at different cadences, providing constant access to fresh insights without manual effort.
  * **Deep Dive Agent Swarm** : A multi-agent orchestration system that splits complex analytics tasks into parallel sub-agents, leveraging Claude's exceptional ability to synthesize results from specialized tools including TextToSQL, code interpreter, vision analysis, web search, MMM, and forecasting. Claude detects anomalies and dynamically refines approaches mid-analysis—switching analytical methods or recalibrating parameters to extract maximum value from each tool without human intervention.
  * **Step Planner** : A Claude-powered component that determines the optimal analytical strategy for each business question, ensuring analyses follow the appropriate approach.
  * **MOI Chat** : Reactive component that handles ~3,000 daily analytics requests through natural language, allowing users to quickly query business metrics.


Claude enables Triple Whale's agents to deliver insights in three simultaneous formats simultaneously—text analysis, data visualization, and interactive data presentations with React components. This multi-format approach helps users understand complex data and take action based on insights that would otherwise require specialized analysts.
## Transforming business operations with AI-powered insights
Triple Whale's Claude-powered agents have revolutionized how brands analyze their data. One customer used the Creative Analysis agent to review 600 marketing assets, reducing a five-hour process to just 10 minutes—freeing their team to focus on strategy rather than manual review.
Another customer achieved their highest revenue day ever, surpassing the previous record by $200,000, by following an agent’s exact recommendation to scale specific areas of marketing spend.
These agents uncover insights that would otherwise remain hidden due to resource constraints. DelPizzo explains, "Our AI agents automatically identify trends and opportunities in the data that brands couldn't find manually. This gives even small teams with limited resources the ability to make data-backed decisions that previously required teams of dedicated analytics specialists."
The ability to schedule agents for regular analysis represents a fundamental shift in operations. Instead of reactively investigating issues, brands receive proactive morning briefings with fresh insights across their business. This keeps teams informed without manual effort, allowing them to spot opportunities and address problems before they escalate.
## Building an AI-augmented future for brands everywhere
Initially optimized for ecommerce and retail, Triple Whale plans to expand to broader industries, while deepening Claude integration throughout their platform. They're actively transitioning from GPT-4 to Claude 3.7 across systems, including their main MOI chat that handles thousands of daily analytics questions.
"Our long-term vision is to expand beyond ecommerce and retail, powering more efficient growth for businesses in any vertical," explains DelPizzo.
Together, Triple Whale and Anthropic are democratizing sophisticated business intelligence—transforming complex data into growth opportunities for companies of any size.
