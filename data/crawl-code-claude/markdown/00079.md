"Claude has changed what's possible for a company our size."

[Chronograph](https://www.chronograph.pe) is a leading portfolio monitoring and analytics platform serving institutional private equity investors. The company supports more than $4 trillion in client capital and serves a majority of the largest General Partners and Limited Partners globally.
With Claude, Chronograph:
  * Achieves 100% employee adoption with 80% daily active usage across all 150+ team members
  * Enables new hires to contribute in Week 2 versus 2+ months previously
  * Replaces expensive vendor tools with custom AI-powered lead generation workflows
  * Enables non-technical teams to build real-time dashboards and analyze data without engineering bottlenecks
  * Launched Chronograph MCP server, enabling private equity clients to connect portfolio data directly to Claude


## The problem
Like many growing SaaS companies, Chronograph faced resource constraints: limited engineering capacity, competing product priorities, and critical business knowledge scattered across systems. The company accumulated valuable business data across systems like HubSpot, Notion, Linear, and internal databases, but teams couldn't efficiently access insights across these silos.
The 150-person team spent significant time on repetitive tasks—client research, document analysis, meeting preparation—that prevented focus on high-value strategic work. Customer success teams manually searched multiple systems before client calls. Sales representatives spent dozens of hours weekly on lead generation. Product and engineering teams relied on lengthy specification documents that slowed development cycles.
## Claude enables AI-first operations across the entire organization
Chronograph selected Claude Enterprise after evaluating alternative platforms. The team identified several key factors: Anthropic's commitment to AI safety aligned with strict security requirements for financial services, Claude's reliability for mission-critical applications, and the Model Context Protocol's ability to connect multiple business systems.
“Anthropic’s commitment to AI safety makes them the partner we want for long-term LLM implementation across our company and client use cases,” said Charlie Tafoya, Co-Founder and CEO at Chronograph. “Claude for Financial Services enables us to provide seamless, secure data exchange for our mutual clients within a trusted technology ecosystem.”
## Transforming collaboration through Projects, Artifacts, and MCP integrations
Chronograph implemented Claude Enterprise through a structured two-month rollout. The company achieved immediate productivity gains as teams began using Claude for email drafting, data analysis, and document review. During the first month, Chronograph established knowledge-sharing systems with searchable databases of successful prompts, Projects, and Artifacts. In the second month, the company launched "AI Salons" where colleagues demonstrate real-world applications, accelerating adoption across teams.
Claude Artifacts transformed Product-Engineering collaboration. "Product can now create working Claude Artifact prototypes that efficiently convey the key capabilities of new features to engineering, turning PRDs into prototypes at speed," said Michael Bridge, Co-Founder and CTO.
The Customer Success team now maintains proactive client management at scale by integrating internal notes, email context, CRM data, and product usage metadata through Claude's context windows. Within two weeks of starting, a junior Client Management team member successfully explained Chronograph's GraphQL API to a client by combining client context from HubSpot MCP, internal documentation from Notion MCP, and Claude's understanding of GraphQL.
Sales teams built custom workflows using Claude to monitor media sources and industry announcements for leads, saving dozens of hours weekly. "Integrating Claude and especially its MCP integrations into our workflows helps our sales reps save significant time on administrative tasks before and after meetings—giving us more time for building relationships and driving outcomes for our revenue pipeline," said Michael Santos, Global Head of Sales.
Non-technical teams now build real-time dashboards through Claude Artifacts and shared prompts that understand business systems and data relationships, eliminating Analytics team bottlenecks. Previously siloed systems—HubSpot, Notion, Gmail, Google Calendar—now work together through Claude's MCP integrations.
## Chronograph launches MCP for private equity investors
Building on its success using Claude Enterprise to scale operations, Chronograph has launched an MCP server that enables its clients to connect their private capital portfolio data managed on the company’s platforms directly to Claude.
[Chronograph’s MCP is available as a Claude direct connector](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12662597-using-chronograph-for-portfolio-monitoring) in the Claude Partners Directory. Through Claude, private equity professionals can instantly analyze fund performance, underlying company metrics, and exposure analytics across their complete private investment portfolio.
“The private capital industry generates massive amounts of portfolio data, but traditional tools often create friction in accessing insights,” said Nicholas Lin, Head of Product for Financial Services, Anthropic. “By connecting Chronograph's comprehensive portfolio monitoring platform with Claude's interface, we're enabling institutional investors to unlock the full potential of their data—moving from data retrieval to strategic insight in seconds.”
## The outcome
Claude has become a core problem-solving tool at Chronograph through a combination of reasoning capabilities, Projects for collaboration, Artifacts for rapid prototyping, and MCP for seamless integration. The company now operates with speed and capabilities that previously would have required larger teams and budgets.
"Claude has changed what's possible for a company our size. I am especially pleased to see how Claude's capabilities have helped our junior employees ramp up and deliver impact beyond their traditional role boundaries," said Tafoya.
The AI-first operating model has become a competitive advantage in client pitches, enabling faster turnaround times and more responsive service. Chronograph handles more complex client needs and product development without traditional headcount scaling, improving unit economics as the company grows.
