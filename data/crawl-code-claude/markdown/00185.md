## Terms for MCP Server Developers
By submitting your MCP server for inclusion in any of Anthropic's Desktop Extensions or Integrations directories (individually or collectively, the “MCP Directory”), you (i) represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to provide your MCP server to users and that your MCP server complies with all applicable laws and regulations; (ii) agree to indemnify and hold Anthropic harmless from any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from your MCP server or users' interaction with it; (iii) grant Anthropic a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to display your name, trademarks, logos, and other branding materials associated with your MCP server in the MCP Directory for the purpose of identifying and promoting your MCP server to users of the MCP Directory; and (iv) authorize Anthropic to perform security testing on your MCP server, to collect and use functional metadata about your MCP server to improve the Anthropic services, and to share such functional metadata with our users. If Anthropic elects to include your MCP server in the MCP Directory, you agree to continue implementing and maintaining quality and security standards for your MCP server that are consistent with [Anthropic's MCP Directory Policy](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11697096-anthropic-mcp-directory-policy) (may be updated from time to time), and you acknowledge that failure to maintain these standards may result in removal from the MCP Directory. You further agree to implement and maintain a mechanism for receiving reports of security vulnerabilities from Anthropic and from third parties and to investigate such reports with a reasonable standard of care. You acknowledge that Anthropic has no obligation to include your MCP server in the MCP Directory and reserves the right to remove your MCP server at any time for any reason (including but not limited to violations of these terms, user complaints, security concerns, or changes to Anthropic's MCP Directory policies) without liability to you. You understand that inclusion in the MCP Directory does not create any partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and Anthropic, nor does it grant you any rights to use Anthropic's name, trademarks, or intellectual property. Anthropic reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time without prior notice, and your continued submission or maintenance of an MCP server in the MCP Directory after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
