> claude fix the authentication error in our login flow
I'll investigate the auth error. Let me look at the relevant files.
‍
Examining auth-related files...
* src/services/authService.js
* src/components/Login.jsx
* src/store/authSlice.js
‍
Running the login flow...
‍
Error detected: "401 Unauthorized: Token expired"
‍
Root cause:
* Token refresh mechanism not handling expired tokens correctly
* Refresh token missing from request header
* Improper error handling for 401 responses
‍
Updating authService.js with proper refresh logic...
Updating request interceptor for 401 handling...
Testing the fix...
‍
* Login successful ✓
* Token refresh working ✓
* Proper redirection on expired tokens ✓
‍
Authentication error fixed! The login flow now properly handles token expiration.

Classify all customer support tickets into the most relevant category.  
  
Here is the list of categories to choose from:  
{{CATEGORY_LIST}}  
  
Here is the content of the support ticket:  
{{TICKET_CONTENT}}
What would you like to improve?
Please include a rationale for the classification.
You are an AI assistant specialized in classifying customer support tickets. Your task is to analyze the content of a given ticket and assign it to the most appropriate category from a predefined list. You will also provide reasoning for your classification decision.
First, let's review the available categories:
<category_list>  
{{CATEGORY_LIST}}  
</category_list>
Now, here is the content of the support ticket you need to classify:
<ticket_content>  
{{TICKET_CONTENT}}  
</ticket_content>
Please follow these steps to complete the task:  
– Carefully read and analyze the ticket content.  
– Consider how the content relates to each of the available categories.  
– Choose the most appropriate category for the ticket.  
– Provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning process.
Use the following structure for your response:  
<classification_analysis>  
In this section, break down your thought process:  
– Quote the most relevant parts of the ticket content.  
– List each category and note how it relates to the ticket content.  
– For each category, provide arguments for and against classifying the ticket into that category.  
– Rank the top 3 most likely categories.  
</classification_analysis>
<classification>  
<category>Your chosen category goes here</category>  
<reasoning>A concise summary of your reasoning for choosing this category</reasoning>  
</classification>
Remember to be thorough in your analysis and clear in your explanation. Your goal is to provide an accurate classification with well-supported reasoning.

Hi Claude! Could you help me develop a unique voice for an audience? If you need more information from me, ask me 1-2 key questions right away. If you think I should upload any documents that would help you do a better job, let me know. You can use the tools you have access to— like Google Drive, web search, etc.—if they’ll help you better accomplish this task. Do not use analysis tool. Please keep your responses friendly, brief and conversational.   
  
Please execute the task as soon as you can—an artifact would be great if it makes sense. If using an artifact, consider what kind of artifact (interactive, visual, checklist, etc.) might be most helpful for this specific task. Thanks for your help!
