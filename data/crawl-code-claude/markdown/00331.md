"We could focus on what we do best while leveraging Claude's inference power for the agentic core."

[Zencoder ](https://zencoder.ai)is a leading provider of AI agents for software engineering, on a mission to help developers ship better software faster through human creativity and AI capability. Founder Andrew Filev and Zencoder’s global team of 60+ engineers are building a platform that delivers enterprise-grade AI coding agents that integrate directly into developer workflows.
## With Claude, Zencoder has achieved:
  * 2x reduction in AI code churn compared to Zencoder’s previous best solution 
  * Million+ lines of code processed across multiple repositories simultaneously 
  * Double-digit productivity gains by enabling AI-first development on production codebases, not just prototypes


## The problem
The professional developers that Zencoder serves come from small ground-breaking startups and Fortune 500 enterprises, but they all have one thing in common: the need for AI assistance to rapidly deliver production-quality code. As power users of AI in their own development process, Zencoder felt their pain.  

The company decided to create a unique enterprise AI coding solution that combined their best-in-class user experience across multiple IDEs (VSCode and JetBrains suite) with Claude's powerful agentic core. They envisioned eliminating the complex and costly traditional VPC setups that many were forced to rely upon by offering Zero VPC Architecture: a local CLI-based solution that enterprise customers could deploy within their own security perimeters.  
  
The platform further would further require fast, deep multi-repository indexing to handle million-line codebases and complex microservices architectures, with cost-efficient access to elite LLMs for tackling sophisticated enterprise code that simpler models couldn't handle. Most of all, Zencoder wanted to provide predictable billing to address a major enterprise pain point: with no way to estimate budget, customers were running out of AI capacity by mid-month, forced to limp along until the next billing cycle. 
“Our goal is to provide enterprise teams with the most capable AI and cost-effective agents for complex repositories,” explained Zencoder founder Andrew Filev. All they needed was a way to transform that vision into a real-world solution.
## Claude Agent SDK helps Zencoder to:
  * Combine Zencoder's best-in-class UX and 100+ integrations with Claude's agentic core and Opus 4.1 inference capabilities in a single, comprehensive platform
  * Support zero-VPC deployment for enterprises _and_ instant self-serve adoption for entry-level users 
  * Achieve 2x a reduction in AI code churn by producing more accurate code that requires less rework
  * Create agents with deep, multi-repository awareness that can understand architecture and track dependencies
  * Extend AI-first development to production repositories, moving beyond prototypes to real-life production code where developers spend most of their time


## Results that scale from prototypes to production
As a company that had been building AI agents for years, Zencoder already possessed deep expertise in agent development. However, the Claude Code SDK offered something unique: it complemented their existing capabilities rather than replacing them. 
The team ultimately integrated the SDK across Zencoder’s entire agent suite, including coding and unit testing agents; specialized agents for tasks like migrations, documentation, and team-specific workflows; and their Zentester end-to-end testing agent that uses UI test automation to validate entire user flows.
“The SDK enabled us to rapidly add Claude Code alongside our own agent core to deliver an incredibly powerful setup with best-in-class capabilities across all layers,” said Filev. “We could focus on what we do best, building exceptional developer experiences and tool integrations, while leveraging Claude's inference power for the agentic core."  
‍  
Using Claude Code’s SDK, Zencoder now offers both instant self-serve adoption for entry-level users and zero-VPC deployment for enterprises with strict security standards. The SDK's industry-standard patterns, particularly support for MCP – which Zencoder had already adopted – made integration natural and straightforward, while the “clean, well-documented APIs” let Zencoder's team skip integration challenges and go right to building features for their visionary agent platform.  
  
The final touch: cost-efficient access to Opus 4.1, essential for handling huge, multi-repository codebases, and Max plan subscriptions. These let Zencoder provide predictable billing, with higher token limits and daily resets, for the controllable budget management that organizations spending millions on AI desperately needed.
## Looking to the future
Zencoder's roadmap focuses on expanding autonomous capabilities and enterprise features. They're working on enhanced CI/CD integration for 24/7 autonomous development, remote agents with security-first deployment, and multi-agent pipelines for handling complex workflows. The team also plans to keep building on their testing strengths to push quality assurance further.
As the Claude Code SDK evolves, Zencoder will continually adopt its improvements to keep the developer experience sharp. Filev’s real goal, though, is changing how enterprise teams approach software development, turning AI into a natural extension of what developers already do instead of another system to wrangle: “Zencoder wants to change how software gets built by automating the boring stuff so you can focus on what matters.”
