The ChEMBL connector gives Claude access to the ChEMBL Database, a manually curated resource of bioactive drug-like compounds with quantitative binding and functional data against biological targets. Search for compounds by name or structure, retrieve bioactivity data (IC50, EC50, Ki values), find drug targets and mechanisms of action, access ADMET properties, and discover approved drugs by indication.
You can use the ChEMBL connector to:
**Research a Drug Target:** "I'm interested in EGFR inhibitors. What are the IC50 values of gefitinib and erlotinib against EGFR?"
**Explore Drug Repurposing:** "Find approved drugs that target BCR-ABL. I want to explore repurposing opportunities."
**Assess Lead Compound Properties:** "I have a compound with ChEMBL ID CHEMBL123456. What are its drug-like properties and how potent is it?"

  * Help me develop a unique voice for an audience
[](https://claude.com/connectors/chembl)
Hi Claude! Could you help me develop a unique voice for an audience? If you need more information from me, ask me 1-2 key questions right away. If you think I should upload any documents that would help you do a better job, let me know. You can use the tools you have access to— like Google Drive, web search, etc.—if they’ll help you better accomplish this task. Do not use analysis tool. Please keep your responses friendly, brief and conversational.   
  
Please execute the task as soon as you can—an artifact would be great if it makes sense. If using an artifact, consider what kind of artifact (interactive, visual, checklist, etc.) might be most helpful for this specific task. Thanks for your help!
