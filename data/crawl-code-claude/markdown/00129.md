Provides access to BioRender template and icon search for scientists.  
  
You can use the BioRender connector to:  
  
Create CRISPR mechanism graphics:  
‍"I need to create a graphical abstract showing how CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing works in plant cells for my NSF grant proposal. I want to show the Cas9 protein, guide RNA, DNA double-strand break, and then the DNA repair process. Can you find me templates for CRISPR mechanisms and plant cell structures?"  
  
Design cell therapy figures:   
"I'm working on a figure for a paper about CAR-T cell therapy targeting solid tumors. I need to illustrate: T cells being engineered with chimeric antigen receptors, the CAR-T cells trafficking through blood vessels to the tumor site, and then binding to tumor antigens. Can you help me find templates or icons that show T cell activation, tumor microenvironment, and cell-cell interactions?"  
  
Visual experimental workflows:   
"I'm presenting our latest RNA-seq results at an upcoming lab meeting and need to explain the experimental workflow to new graduate students. Can you find icons and templates showing: tissue sample collection, RNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis pipeline?"

  * Help me develop a unique voice for an audience
[](https://claude.com/connectors/biorender)
Hi Claude! Could you help me develop a unique voice for an audience? If you need more information from me, ask me 1-2 key questions right away. If you think I should upload any documents that would help you do a better job, let me know. You can use the tools you have access to— like Google Drive, web search, etc.—if they’ll help you better accomplish this task. Do not use analysis tool. Please keep your responses friendly, brief and conversational.   
  
Please execute the task as soon as you can—an artifact would be great if it makes sense. If using an artifact, consider what kind of artifact (interactive, visual, checklist, etc.) might be most helpful for this specific task. Thanks for your help!
