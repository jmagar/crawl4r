## Keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts may vary by platform and terminal. Press `?` to see available shortcuts for your environment.**macOS users** : Option/Alt key shortcuts (`Alt+B`, `Alt+F`, `Alt+Y`, `Alt+M`, `Alt+P`) require configuring Option as Meta in your terminal:
  * **iTerm2** : Settings → Profiles → Keys → Set Left/Right Option key to “Esc+”
  * **Terminal.app** : Settings → Profiles → Keyboard → Check “Use Option as Meta Key”
  * **VS Code** : Settings → Profiles → Keys → Set Left/Right Option key to “Esc+”

See [Terminal configuration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-config) for details.

## Command history
Claude Code maintains command history for the current session:
  * History is stored per working directory
  * Cleared with `/clear` command
  * Use Up/Down arrows to navigate (see keyboard shortcuts above)
  * **Note** : History expansion (`!`) is disabled by default


### Reverse search with Ctrl+R
Press `Ctrl+R` to interactively search through your command history:
  1. **Start search** : Press `Ctrl+R` to activate reverse history search
  2. **Type query** : Enter text to search for in previous commands - the search term will be highlighted in matching results
  3. **Navigate matches** : Press `Ctrl+R` again to cycle through older matches
  4. **Accept match** : 
     * Press `Tab` or `Esc` to accept the current match and continue editing
     * Press `Enter` to accept and execute the command immediately
  5. **Cancel search** : 
     * Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel and restore your original input
     * Press `Backspace` on empty search to cancel

The search displays matching commands with the search term highlighted, making it easy to find and reuse previous inputs.
## Background bash commands
Claude Code supports running bash commands in the background, allowing you to continue working while long-running processes execute.
### How backgrounding works
When Claude Code runs a command in the background, it runs the command asynchronously and immediately returns a background task ID. Claude Code can respond to new prompts while the command continues executing in the background. To run commands in the background, you can either:
  * Prompt Claude Code to run a command in the background
  * Press Ctrl+B to move a regular Bash tool invocation to the background. (Tmux users must press Ctrl+B twice due to tmux’s prefix key.)

**Key features:**
  * Output is buffered and Claude can retrieve it using the BashOutput tool
  * Background tasks have unique IDs for tracking and output retrieval
  * Background tasks are automatically cleaned up when Claude Code exits

To disable all background task functionality, set the `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS` environment variable to `1`. See [Environment variables](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) for details. **Common backgrounded commands:**
  * Build tools (webpack, vite, make)
  * Package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm)
  * Test runners (jest, pytest)
  * Development servers
  * Long-running processes (docker, terraform)


### Bash mode with `!` prefix
Run bash commands directly without going through Claude by prefixing your input with `!`:
```
! npm test
! git status
! ls -la

```

Bash mode:
  * Adds the command and its output to the conversation context
  * Shows real-time progress and output
  * Supports the same `Ctrl+B` backgrounding for long-running commands
  * Does not require Claude to interpret or approve the command

This is useful for quick shell operations while maintaining conversation context.
